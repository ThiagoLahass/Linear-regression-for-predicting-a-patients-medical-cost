# Linear Regression to Predict Medical Costs

This mini-project applies linear regression to predict a patient's medical cost using a dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The dataset can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sudhirnl7/linear-regression-tutorial/data).

## Steps

1. **Prepare Data for Use**
   - Read the data
   - Clean the data
   - Encode categorical columns

2. **Plot Information to Gain Insights**
   - Visualize the distribution of charges
   - Plot correlation matrix
   - Explore relationships between features

3. **Train a Model**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train Linear Regression and SGD Regression models

4. **Check the Results**
   - Compare real and predicted values
   - Evaluate model performance using various metrics

## Requirements

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy scikit-learn
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python linear_regression_medical_costs.py
   ```

## Results

The project includes plots visualizing data distributions and relationships, model training results, and performance metrics for both Linear Regression and SGD Regression models.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of linear regression techniques to predict medical costs and provides insights into the relationships between different features and medical charges.
